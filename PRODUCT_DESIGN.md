# Newsletter Digest Bot - Product Design Document

## Executive Summary

The Newsletter Digest Bot is a personal tool designed to help users efficiently gather high-signal information from trusted voices and widely referenced industry newsletters. The goal is to deliver a concise, relevant news digest that surfaces insights from your preferred sources and highlights topics that are trending or frequently mentioned across the industry. All processing, storage, and UI is at the news item level, not the email level.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
- Too much noise: Generic headlines crowd out genuinely useful or interesting content
- Hard to track top voices: It's difficult to keep up with updates from people or sources you care about
- Weak trend detection: Hard to spot what is being widely discussed or referenced
- No easy way to filter or personalize: Most tools don't adapt to your interests or let you tune the signal

### Target User Profile
**Primary User**: Anyone who wants a more efficient way to keep up with important news and insights from trusted sources and industry newsletters, with a focus on:
- Getting updates from specific people or sources
- Seeing what topics or stories are being widely referenced
- Saving time by filtering out low-value or repetitive content

## Vision & Strategy

### Product Vision
"A personal tool to help you quickly scan, filter, and digest the most relevant news and insights from your favorite sources and the broader industry."

### Key Principles
1. **Signal over Noise**: Prioritize genuinely useful or referenced content
2. **Source Awareness**: Make it easy to follow updates from people or sources you care about
3. **Trend Detection**: Highlight what is being widely discussed or referenced
4. **Personal Relevance**: Let users tune the feed to their interests
5. **Simplicity**: Fast, clear, and easy to use

## Core Features & Requirements

### 1. Source Management
- Add/remove newsletter senders you want to follow
- Only emails from active sources (or matching newsletter heuristics) are processed
- Option to set source priority or "favorite" certain senders

### 2. Content Extraction & Summarization
- Use AI to extract and summarize individual news items from emails
- Each news item is stored with its own metadata (title, summary, content, topics, entities, etc.)
- Avoid over-segmentation and over-generalization

### 3. Trend & Consensus Detection
- Group similar news items using semantic similarity
- Highlight stories or topics that are referenced by multiple newsletters
- Show which sources mentioned each item
- Configurable grouping parameters (similarity threshold, max per query)

### 4. Personalization & Filtering
- Mark items as "more like this" or "less like this" to tune future digests
- Option to mute generic or low-value topics
- Filter by source, topic, or entity

### 5. Digest Experience
- Top section: Updates from your favorite sources
- Trending/consensus: Most referenced news items across all newsletters
- Discover: New or emerging topics/entities/tools
- All sections are populated by individual news items, not just newsletter emails

### 6. Allowed Sender Management
- Add/remove allowed senders (full email or domain)
- Input validation and duplicate prevention
- Enhanced list display (email/domain icons, source name if available)
- Backend API for managing allowed senders
- React hook for fetching, adding, and removing allowed senders

### 7. Roadmap (Phases)
- **MVP**: Gmail OAuth integration, fetch and summarize newsletters, mobile-first UI, daily/weekly digest
- **Multi-source Aggregation**: Ingest multiple newsletters, extract and split all news items, present in a single feed
- **Consensus Grouping & Ranking**: Group similar news items, assign consensus scores, rank and display at the top
- **Personalization**: Star/follow sources, feedback and muting, filter by topic/entity
- **Trending & Discover**: Highlight trending topics, show new or emerging items
- **Advanced Retrieval**: Store news items and metadata in a vector database, enable semantic and metadata-based retrieval
