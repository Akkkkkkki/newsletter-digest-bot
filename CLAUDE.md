   - **AVOID OVERENGINEERING** - This is a small friend group application
   - Question if complex solutions are truly needed
   - Prefer simple, maintainable code over clever optimizations
   - Remove unused code, dependencies, or features
   - Ensure new code follows existing patterns and conventions

3. **Quality Checks Before Committing** ‚úÖ
   - Run `npm run build` locally to ensure deployment won't fail
   - Run `npm run lint` to catch code quality issues
   - Test critical functionality manually
   - Verify all imports resolve correctly
   - Check that environment variables are properly configured

4. **Git Workflow** üöÄ
   - Create feature branches for all changes: `git checkout -b feature-name`
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Push changes: `git push -u origin feature-name`
   - **ALWAYS raise a PR** - never push directly to main
   - Use the PR template format:
     ```

## Architecture Overview

This is an AI-powered newsletter digest bot that processes Gmail newsletters and provides intelligent summaries. The system operates at the individual news item level (not email level) and focuses on consensus/trending detection across multiple sources.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Vercel serverless functions (Node.js API routes in `/api`)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for embeddings)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT for content extraction, summarization, and semantic embeddings
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with Gmail OAuth integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel (configured via vercel.json)

### Key Directory Structure

## Core Data Model

The system processes newsletters into individual news items with the following key entities:

- **newsletter_sources**: User-managed allowed newsletter senders
- **newsletters**: Raw newsletter emails from Gmail
- **news_items**: Individual news stories extracted from newsletters (with embeddings)
- **story_mentions**: Clustered/grouped news items showing cross-source mentions
- **story_mention_news_items**: Join table linking stories to news items

All processing happens at the news item granularity, not the email level.

## Key Processing Flow

1. **Gmail Integration**: Fetch newsletters from user's Gmail via OAuth
2. **Content Extraction**: Use OpenAI to extract individual news items from each newsletter
3. **Embedding Generation**: Create semantic embeddings for each news item
4. **Story Clustering**: Group similar news items across sources to detect consensus/trending topics
5. **Ranking**: Surface top-referenced stories and voice-prioritized updates

## Environment Variables

The application requires these environment variables (check .env files for current values):
- `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`
- `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Database Management

- **Schema**: Current schema is in Supabase, with migrations tracked in `supabase/migrations/`
- **pgvector**: The database uses pgvector extension for semantic similarity search
- **RLS**: Row Level Security policies ensure user data isolation
- **Functions**: Custom database functions handle embedding operations and triggers

## API Endpoints

Key API routes handle specific functionality:
- `/api/newsletters/process` - Main newsletter processing pipeline
- `/api/newsletters/sources` - Manage allowed newsletter senders  
- `/api/headlines/top-referenced` - Get consensus/trending stories
- `/api/headlines/voice-updates` - Get updates from prioritized sources

## Important Implementation Notes

- **No Tests**: Currently no test framework is configured
- **Async Processing**: Story clustering happens asynchronously to avoid blocking newsletter processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging via `processing_logs` table
- **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of OpenAI API rate limits when processing many newsletters
- **Database Access**: Use `lib/supabase.node.js` for server-side database operations
- **Mobile-First**: UI is designed for mobile-first headline scanning experience

## Common Workflows

- **Adding New Sources**: Users manage newsletter sources via the sources API/UI
- **Processing Pipeline**: Triggered manually or via scheduled jobs to fetch and process new newsletters
- **Story Clustering**: Automatic grouping of similar news items across sources using embeddings and entity matching
- **Consensus Detection**: Ranking stories by cross-source mention frequency and credibility scores

## üöÄ Deployment Notes & Common Issues

### Vercel Deployment Issue (2025-08-29)

**Issue**: Build failed due to missing `lib/` files with Module not found errors:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/supabase'
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/config'
```

**Root Cause**: The `lib/` directory was in `.gitignore`, causing essential files like `lib/supabase.ts`, `lib/config.js`, `lib/types.ts`, and `lib/gmail.js` to be excluded from the repository.

**Fix Applied**: Force-added required lib files using `git add -f lib/*.{ts,js}` to ensure deployment has all dependencies.

**For Developers**: 
- Always verify that imported files are committed to the repository
- Check that `.gitignore` isn't excluding essential application files
- Test builds locally with `npm run build` before deploying
- If you add new files to `lib/`, use `git add -f` to override gitignore when necessary

### Supabase Environment Variable Issue (2025-08-29) - CORRECTED

**Issue**: Build failed during static page generation with error:
```
Error: supabaseUrl is required.
Error occurred prerendering page "/"
```

**Root Cause**: Environment variable naming inconsistency between local development and Vercel deployment. Vercel was missing the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed environment variables that the client-side code requires.

**Fix Applied**: The issue was NOT with the code - it was with environment variable configuration in Vercel.

**CRITICAL: Environment Variable Setup for Vercel Deployment**:
Vercel must have these environment variables configured in the dashboard:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - The Supabase project URL (client-side accessible)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - The Supabase anonymous key (client-side accessible)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` - Gmail OAuth client ID (client-side accessible)

**For Developers**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed variables are accessible to browser/client code and required for static generation
- DO NOT create placeholder logic - fix the environment variable configuration instead
- Always ensure Vercel environment variables match the variable names used in the code
- Test builds locally with `npm run build` but remember local .env.local may have different variable names than production

### Essential Lib Files for Deployment
These files must be present for successful deployment:
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Client-side Supabase configuration
- `lib/config.js` - Application configuration constants  
- `lib/types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `lib/gmail.js` - Gmail API integration
- `lib/openai.js` - OpenAI API wrapper with rate limiting
- `lib/validation.js` - Input validation utilities
- `lib/rateLimiter.js` - Rate limiting implementation
- `lib/tokenStorage.ts` - Secure token storage utilities
